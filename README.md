# Rock vs Mine Prediction

This project focuses on predicting whether an object detected in sonar signals is a rock or a mine using machine learning techniques. It involves preprocessing the sonar data, engineering features, and training classification models to achieve accurate predictions.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing techniques including normalization and encoding.
- Feature engineering to enhance model performance.
- Utilization of various classification algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks.
- Evaluation metrics for assessing model performance.
- Visualization of model results and analysis of predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of sonar signals obtained from a naval research laboratory, with each signal labeled as either a rock or a mine. The dataset is included in the repository for easy access.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Follow the instructions in the codebase to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.
